                I am a B.Tech student at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Calicut, specializing in Mechanical Engineering.  I've developed a deep understanding of front-end and back-end technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and various database management systems like MySQL and MongoDB. My journey in web development has allowed me to work on a diverse range of projects, from small business websites to large-scale web applications, where Iâ€™ve consistently delivered clean, maintainable code and intuitive user experiences. Beyond coding, I am an avid learner, always exploring the latest tech trends and best practices to keep my skills sharp.
